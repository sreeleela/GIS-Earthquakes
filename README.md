# GIS-Earthquakes
This application is a GIS tool showcasing the top 20 devastating earthquakes of 21st Century. It has a tool tip text feature on the map, which gives the name of place when the cursor is placed on the point. The user can select or query earthquake cities based on magnitude or place by entering the values in the text box. This gives an interactive environment for users to explore more on earthquakes. For every earthquake city, there is a link where the user can find more information. There are various other options through which user can customize the application.<br>
You can clone the application from here. You will get a zip file, and you can unzip it anywhere, but a typical place would be as a folder in the C drive on a PC. The folder will be called GISProject, and will contain a file called earthquakes.jar, and you should double click on the earthquakes.jar file to start up the application.
